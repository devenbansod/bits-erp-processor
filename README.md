Guidelines to Contributing
==========================

1. Clone the repo at : https://github.com/devenbansod/erp-volunteers.git
2. For every feature change, create a new branch before making any change.
3. Make changes to the branch. (Do not pull anything till you reach the last step)
4. Generate a patch file by : git format-patch master --stdout > ajinkya-31-03.patch
5. This will create a patch of the changes that are done on the new branch with respect to the local master 
6. Send this file to me(devenbansod.bits@gmail.com) by email.
7. I will apply the patch locally and if everything seems fine, I will push it to the master.



NOTE : ** If you want to continue working while I have not reviewed and merged your patch, please do so by creating and editing a new branch locally and then later create a patch for that branch and send it too. **
